Caesar Cipher Technique is the simple and easy method of encryption technique.
It is simple type of substitution cipher.
Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet.

Explanation
The plain text character is traversed one at a time.
For each character in the given plain text, transform the given character as per the rule depending on the procedure of encryption and decryption of text.
After the steps is followed, a new string is generated which is referred as cipher text.

Hacking of Caesar Cipher Algorithm
The cipher text can be hacked with various possibilities. One of such possibility is Brute Force Technique, which involves trying every possible decryption key. 
This technique does not demand much effort and is relatively simple for a hacker.
